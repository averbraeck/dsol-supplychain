/**
 * A MessageStore is taking care of storing messages for later use, for instance for matching purposes. It acts as an ERP or
 * database system for the supply chain actor. In this implementation, all the messages are linked to an InternalDemand, as this
 * sets off the whole chain of messages, no matter whether it is a purchase, internal production, or stock replenishment: in all
 * cases the InternalDemand triggers all the other messages.
