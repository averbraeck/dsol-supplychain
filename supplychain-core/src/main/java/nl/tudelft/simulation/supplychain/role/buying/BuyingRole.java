/**
 * The buying role is a role that can handle several types of message content: internal demand, order confirmation, bill, and
 * shipment. Depending on the extension of the BuyingRole, which actually indicates the type if InternalDemandPolicy used,
 * several other messages can be handled as well. For the InternalDemandPolicyOrder, no extra types are necessary. For the
 * InternalDemandhandlerRFQ, a Quote has to be handled as well. For an InternalDemandhandlerYP, a YellowPageAnswer can be
 * received, and has to be handled.
