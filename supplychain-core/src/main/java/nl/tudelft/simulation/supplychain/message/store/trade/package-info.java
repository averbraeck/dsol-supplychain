/**
 * MessageStore for instances of TradeMessage. The EmptyTradeMessageStore does not store any messages for retrieval. The
 * TradeMessageStore keeps messages related to an InternalDemand till the entire transaction is over. The LeanTradeMessageStore
 * also looks for timeouts, and removes messages when no reply is given before the timeout. This avoids the problem of the
 * TradeMessageStore that keeps the non-answered conversations eternally.
